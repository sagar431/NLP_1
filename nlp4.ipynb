    "1. Applications of sequence-to-sequence RNNs include language translation, speech recognition, and text summarization. Sequence-to-vector RNNs can be used for sentiment analysis, text classification, and image captioning. Vector-to-sequence RNNs can be used for music generation, text completion, and speech synthesis.\n",
    "2. Encoder-decoder RNNs are useful for automatic translation because they can handle input and output sequences of different lengths, while also being able to remember information from the input sequence when generating the output sequence.\n",
    "3. A convolutional neural network can be used to extract features from frames of a video, and an RNN can be used to process these features sequentially and classify the video based on its overall content.\n",
    "4. dynamic_rnn() allows for variable-length input sequences, while static_rnn() requires that all input sequences have the same length.\n",
    "5. Variable-length input sequences can be handled by padding shorter sequences with zeros to match the length of the longest sequence, or by using techniques like bucketing to group sequences of similar lengths together. Variable-length output sequences can be handled by using a special end-of-sequence token to indicate when the output sequence is complete.\n",
    "6. One common approach to distributing training and execution of a deep RNN across multiple GPUs is to use data parallelism, where each GPU is responsible for computing the gradients for a different subset of the training examples. The gradients are then combined and used to update the model parameters. Another approach is model parallelism, where different GPUs are responsible for different parts of the model."
